# Power BI Market Analysis
I took on this personal project for Solarable (a growing start-up focusing on increasing solar energy accessibility, solving everyday problems using renewable energy, and data-driven solutions) to improve my visualisations skills on Power BI, especially on making interactive dashboards.

I created these dashboards with skills and knowledge gained upon completing my Microsoft: Power BI Data Analyst Associate Certification back in March 2025. This certificaiton has allowed me to shift from just visualising data to asking the right business questions, designing visuals that support decision-making, and using filter, slicers, and drill-throughs to enhance interactivity.

It is currently a work in progress, reflecting my ongoing journey through data analytics. The interactive dashboards I've worked on are based on the International Energy Agency (IEA) Global EV data 2024 dataset that contains information such as EV sales and powetrain types.

As I continue to advance, I look forward to exploring more concepts and refining these dashboards to offer a comprehensive understanding of data analytics.

## Dataset

The dataset can be found as part of the IEA Global EV Outlook 2024, [IEA Global EV Outlook 2024](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/global-ev-outlook-2024#global-ev-data).

## Visualisation

### 1. Electric Vehicle Sales
The sales of a region serves as a valuable metric for assessing a region's market share. This dashboard levergaes key performance indidcators (KPIs), including the total EV sales (EVS) as a benchmark, the trend in EVS and yearly sales from 2010 to 2024 providing a comprehensive insight into CO2 emission reduction performance.
